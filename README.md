# tic tac toe

*Normally I would upload the PDF, but this will be a public repo, and I don't want to give away the question, or requirement*

## Scope
1. Single player game on ember js
2. Multiplayer, limited implementation using ruby
3. Multiplayer using websockets - Serious stretch goal

## Approach

Beacuse I still don't know ember and rails, I will not start off with testing, and rather looking for feedback in the API / output. Once I understand more about the frameworks I will retrospectively add more tests
